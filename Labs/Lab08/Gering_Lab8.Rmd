## LOGISTIC GROWTH BACKGROUND

```{LOGISTIC GROWTH BACKGROUND}

This document contains the functions about the logistic growth model that measures the populations abundances over time given an intrinsic growth rate, starting population, carrying capacity, and generations. You can find the final metadata and results file [here](https://github.com/smgering/CompBioLabsAndHW/tree/main/Labs08)

```

## LOGISTIC GROWTH EQUATION

```{LOGISTIC GROWTH EQUATION}

The logistic growth equation is the following:
  
n[t] <- n[t-1] + ( r * n[t-1] * (K - n[t-1])/K )

Where n[t] is the abundance of the population at time t, n[t â€“ 1] is the abundance of the population in the previous time step, r is the intrinsic growth rate of the population, and K is the environmental carrying capacity for the population.

```

## LOGISTICAL MODEL FUNCTION

```{LOGISTICAL MODEL FUNCTION}

# Function Definition
Logistic_Growth <- function( r, K, t, n) {
  abundance <- rep(n, t)
  for (i in 2:t) {
    abundance[i] <- ((abundance[i-1] + ((r * abundance[i-1]) * ((K - abundance[i-1]) / K )))) 
  }
  return(abundance)
}

# Demonstration of Usage with numerical information about each component in the function
Logistic_Growth(0.8, 10000, 12, 2500) 

```

## LOGISTICAL MODEL OF THE PLOT

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
r <- 0.8
K <- 10000

Logistic_Growth <- function( n, t ) {
  abundance <- rep(n, t)
  generations <- rep(2:t)
  for (i in 2:t) {
    abundance[i] <- ((abundance[i-1] + ((r * abundance[i-1]) * ((K - abundance[i-1]) / K )))) 
  } 
  return(abundance)
  return(generations)
}

myResults <- Logistic_Growth( 2500, 12 ) # Function Results

Logistic_Plot <- plot(myResults, xlab="generations", ylab="abundance")

```
