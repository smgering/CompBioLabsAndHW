* This directory contains my lab coursework for Computational Biology EBIO 5420 taught by Dr. Sam Flaxman at the University of Colorado Boulder during the spring semester of 2021.

* The goals of this class is to develop a strong working knowledge in programming using my _computer terminal_, _GitHub_ and _R Studio_. 

* All code submissions in this directory are for practice and strengthening my programming skills, enabling me to apply these learned tools to my computational projects for my graduate research.  Further, to be able to submit my working code to Github for transparency and reproducibility to collaborators and the greater scientific community.

* You can find my working documents with code in my [repository](https://github.com/smgering) in [Labs](https://github.com/smgering/CompBioLabsAndHW/tree/main/Labs)
