This directory contains my lab coursework for Computational Biology EBIO 5420 taught by Dr. Sam Flaxman at the University of Colorado Boulder during the spring semester of 2021.

These labs' goals are to develop a strong working knowledge in programming using my computer terminal, GitHub and R Studio. 

All code submissions in this directory are for practice and strengthening my programming skills, enabling me to apply these learned tools to my computational projects for my graduate research. Further, to be able to submit my working code to Github for transparency and reproducibility to collaborators and the greater scientific community.
